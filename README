Code to kickstart and launch pilots for virtual machines on the cloud, 
as well as kickstart and configuration files for the VMs themselves.


The VM will expect one of the following data formats in the user data:

For EC2:
    [Base64 encoded blob]####[additional arguments]

    OR

    [ini file]

"####" was picked because it will never appear in the base64 encoded string and
we will make it a rule that it won't appear in the ini file.
